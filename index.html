Welcome.

<p>
  Our goal is to highlight exceptional academic contributions.
  We review candidate contributions and apply doubt.
</p>

<p>
  Reviews will endeavour to explain why a given paper is or is not important.

&#8493; &raquo; concise <br>
&#8455; &raquo; be unpredictable from existing knowledge <br>
&#9879; &raquo; be easy for readers to understand <br>
&raquo; replicate the same results tomorrow <br>
