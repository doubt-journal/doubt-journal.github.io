<h2>Lagrangian neural networks</h2>

<textbox>
underlying symmetries. = invariants
</textbox>

The authors motivate their work via related work showing that <i>"neural networks struggle to learn basic symmetries and conservation laws."</i> However, this paper doesn't solve this isse, rather it allows neural networks to be used in cases where symmetries ... by building the symmetry into the structure of the neural network.

Wrong? Are symmetries a result of a largrangian?!?


$$
S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} T(q_t, \dot q_t) - V(q_t, \dot q_t) dt
$$
